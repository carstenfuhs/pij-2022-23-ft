Recursion:
something defined in terms of "itself"

(1) methods
Method calls itself to solve a problem
  (a) base case: simple inputs (n <= 0) -> direct solution
  (b) recursive case: "complex" inputs
      - make a step towards the solution
      - make the problem slightly easier (n -> n-1)

(2) data types / classes
Class defined with a member variable of the same type
examples:
  - linked list
      public class ListNode {
          private int value;
          private ListNode next;
      }
  - tree
      public class TreeNode {
          private int value;
          private TreeNode left;
          private TreeNode right;
      }

For lists, loops and recursion are about equally easy
to read (and implement).
For trees, recursive methods make writing algorithms easier.
