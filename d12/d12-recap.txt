Automated testing
JUnit
unit tests
- create tests (annotation @Test)
- basic functionality tests, border cases, illegal inputs (-> exception), test with timeout

assertEquals(expected, actual);
assertThrows
assertTimeout

"find bugs once"
- reproduce bug (erroneous behaviour)
- reproduce bug programmatically
- write a test case that triggers the bug and expects correct behaviour
- only now repair the bug in the program

Then you can be sure that the program will not "regress" to its earlier
incorrect state (for this input) without this being noticed.
